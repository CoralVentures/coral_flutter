# Coral Flutter

Welcome to Coral Flutter. Here we will describe an *opinionated* approach to developing [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/) applications with [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc).

If you'd like to play around with the coral_flutter framework, you can create a new counter application by running:

```sh
./create_app.sh my_app
```

_Note: to wire up Segment and Sentry, make sure you have [direnv](https://direnv.net/) installed (`brew install direnv`), copy the `.envrc.sample` file to `.envrc`, and replace the environment variables with your segment and sentry secrets_
