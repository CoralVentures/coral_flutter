# Coral Flutter

**ATTENTION**: We use coral_flutter for our projects and it is a thin extension on top of [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc). While we are happy to share our code with the community, we will not be supporting it. In other words, we will not put coral_flutter on pub.dev, we will not respond to issues or feature requests, and we will be making breaking changes regularly to meet our needs.

## Read the docs

To read the docs make sure you have [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) installed:

```sh
brew install mkdocs
```

Then serve the docs:

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

And go to localhost:8000
